# Guidance for using docker

## Prerequisites

- Node v20+ (to execute npm helper scripts only)
- Docker v18.06.0+ (to run the docker services)

You'll also need to initialise a local docker swarm before you can run the infrastructure or services locally. To do so, run the following
command (you'll only need to do this once):

```shell script
docker swarm init
```

## Infrastructure

The [infrastructure.yml](infrastructure.yml) docker-compose file contains most that the service depends on to run. The application needs redis, which is available to run as a docker-compose file in the rod-catch-returns-js-api

To start the infrastructure, run the following command in the root of the rod-catch-returns-frontend repository:

```shell script
npm run docker:infrastructure
```

This will start a docker stack named `rcrfi` you should be able to see this listed by typing `docker stack ls`
Should you need to, this stack can be terminated by running `docker stack rm rcrfi`

## Services

To support running the services locally using docker, there are two different docker-compose files:

- [services.build.yml](services.build.yml)
  > This contains the necessary definitions to allow docker images to be built both in development and production mode
- [services.dev.yml](services.dev.yml)
  > This contains the necessary definitions to allow the services to be run in development mode.
  > In development mode, the images mount the filesystem of the host to execute the service in containers. This is useful
  > to quickly run all of the services and containers will automatically restart whenever changes are made to the source.
  > This is accomplished by using pm2-dev which automatically watches the filesystem for changes.

In order to run the services locally, you'll need to to rename the env files in the in the [env](env) folder to include a leading dot and removing .example. You'll need to insert the appropriate values into the environment files ending with .secrets.env. Run the command below in the `/docker/env` folder then get values for secret files from gitlab repo fish/rod-catch-returns-env-vars.'

To rename the files:
```shell script
cp angler.env.example .angler.env
cp angler.secrets.env.example .angler.secrets.env
cp fmt.env.example .fmt.env
cp fmt.secrets.env.example .fmt.secrets.env
```

#### Development mode

Ensure that you have the packages properly setup on your host system by running `npm install` in the root of the repository.

To build the images:

```shell script
npm run docker:build
```

To run the services:

```shell script
npm run docker:services-dev
```

To stop the running services

```shell script
docker stack rm rcrfs
```

### HTTPS

In order for the OAuth 2.0 authentication to work on a users development environment for the admin version of the service, it is necessary to run the service using HTTPS.

To do this an nginx ssl reverse proxy has been provided which will serve the pages from:

1. [https://localhost:3043]() - angler frontend
2. [https://localhost:4043]() - fmt frontend

The reverse proxy is started as part of the infrastructure stack (rli), however a root certificate will need to be installed on the keychain of the local machine.

The root certificate file can be found at

```
./resources/infrastructure/nginx/ca/ca.pem
```

In order to add the root certificate to the keychain the following command in the `/docker` folder on MAC-OS:

```shell script
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k "/Library/Keychains/System.keychain" ./resources/infrastructure/nginx/ca/ca.pem
```

Alternatively the graphical application `Key Chain access app` may be used. There are analogous processes available for Windows; "Credential Manager" that can be found in "Control Panel" and "update-ca-certificates" for Ubuntu.

This procedure will not work if the user is using Firefox. Firefox uses Mozilla's proprietary root certificate store NSS.
